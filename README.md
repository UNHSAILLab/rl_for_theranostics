# Data-Driven Modeling and Decision Support for Personalized Precision Oncology

## Introduction
This repository contains the code and Jupyter notebooks for our project on data-driven modeling and decision support systems in personalized precision oncology. We leverage techniques such as Physiologically Based Pharmacokinetic (PBPK) models, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to create dynamic, personalized treatment plans for cancer therapies.
